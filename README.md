# ghostinit: A Nullrider

### Nullrider = A personal philosophy and approach to coding and life in general

#### Core Beliefs
- Privacy > Convienience
- Simplicity > Bloat
- Owning your system > Paying someone else to
- Humanity & Compassion > profit
- Purpose > Blindly Following

- Push back against data harvesting and survielence
- Write clean, functional code
- Live honestly
- Admit and correct mistakes
- Be kind (even when its hard)
- Stand up for what you know to be true and just
- Don't give up
- Collaborate openly with like minded people
- Help others escape corporate ecosystems should the choose to try

#### How I am applying this in my life

My goal is to setup my own personal digital backend. Including:
- Cloud storage / access
- Password management
- CalDav & CardDav

I will start here, evaluate functionality and expand from there.
Ultimately I hope to (as much as possible) be free of the ecosystems
of the 3 major players: Microsoft, Apple & Google.

See this repo for progress updates.
