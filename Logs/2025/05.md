At the lake.  Setting up dev laptop.  Might explore creating express base package common to all builds.

Was able to get a couple repos 'NullriderCoreJS' & 'NullriderJSTemplate' setup and basic functionality.  Plan to use these to build out a robust template for future projects 'NullNexus' & 'LyonLakeHouse'.
