At the lake.  Setting up dev laptop.  Might explore creating express base package common to all builds.

Was able to get a couple repos 'NullriderCoreJS' & 'NullriderJSTemplate' setup and basic functionality.  Plan to use these to build out a robust template for future projects 'NullNexus' & 'LyonLakeHouse'.

Going to experiment with CALDAV/CARDDAV servers.  RADICALE looks promising.  Gonna spin up an instance and see if I can get DAVx^5 to see it on my local network.  Then go from there.

Successfully setup RADCALE and tested through a cloudflared tunnel.  Next steps are to get it setup on the home rig.  Before that though I need to setup and harden my proxy VM.  I plan to setup a DATA vm that will (eventually) handle carddav/caldav, cloud file hosting and postgres.

Last night I was able to successfully setup a proxy VM.  It felt like quite an accomplishment.  I will practice running through it a couple more times.  Seems like it would be nice to build a setup  package.  It would contain the script to update and install everything, full instructions and template config files for nginx and cloudflared.  I think with a bit more work I can go from fresh VM to setup in under 30 min, verses the 3 to 4 hours it took me last night.

I've decided also that I need to focus a bit more on The Odin Project.  While I'm having a blast setting up servers and proxies and VMs, it will be finishing TOP that will make me employable.  My dream, of course, to have a remote job.
